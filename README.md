**Features**


Data Retrieval: Utilize the Reddit API to access top posts from a chosen subreddit.

Text Preprocessing: Clean, tokenize, and transform text data to prepare it for analysis.

Sentiment Analysis: Employ the TextBlob library to determine sentiment polarity (positive, negative, neutral) of post titles.




Data Visualization: Create informative visualizations, including sentiment distribution charts, to present findings.



GitHub Collaboration: Share your insights and engage with the data science community on GitHub.


**Project Workflow**


Data Collection: Obtain top posts from the chosen subreddit using the Reddit API.
